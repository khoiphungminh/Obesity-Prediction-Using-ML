# Obesity-Prediction-Using-ML

## Overview
This project utilizes machine learning to predict obesity levels based on individual eating habits and physical conditions using a dataset from Colombia, Peru, and Mexico. The analysis includes exploratory data analysis, data preprocessing, and the application of various machine learning models.

## Dataset
The dataset includes 17 attributes and 2111 records, labeled with the class variable 'NObesity' (Obesity Level). It features a mix of 77% synthetically generated data and 23% data collected directly from users.

## Features
- Gender, Age, Height, Weight
- Family history with overweight
- Eating habits (high caloric food consumption, vegetable consumption, number of main meals, food between meals)
- Lifestyle choices (smoking, drinking water, calorie monitoring, physical activity, technological device usage, alcohol consumption, transportation method)

## Analysis and Models
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Identification of patterns and relationships.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Feature encoding, normalization, and train-test split.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, and others.
- **Model Evaluation:** Using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC score.

## Tool Used
- Python
- Libraries: numpy, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, sklearn
